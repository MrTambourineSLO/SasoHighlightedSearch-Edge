# Saso Highlighted Search - Edge

## Installation
Coming soon

## Usage
This plugin is pretty straightforward, it allows you to search highlighted text from the context menu of your browser using four search
engines, i.e.
- Google
- Bing
- Yahoo
- Wikipedia

Note: All search engines are set to English language.

To change your preferred search engine in context menu, click the white on blue looking glass icon in browser action area, select your
preferred option and submit.

This plugin is essentially a fork of my [chrome plugin](https://github.com/MrTambourineSLO/SasoHighlightedSearch). Only things changed are those scaffolded by MS Edge Extension Toolkit and some minor changes I made to replace unsupported APIs (e.g. I had to replace chrome.storage.sync with local storage and other minor tweaks).
## Credits
All code, unless otherwise stated in code comments was written by me.

## License
Do whatever you want with it, but in the unlikely case that your computer explodes into a mushroom cloud I take no responibility.
